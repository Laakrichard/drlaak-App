<h3>About the Upcoming Seminar</h3>

<p>"Times have been tough for millions of Africans who have either lost their jobs in the past decade or waiting endlessly for a job that may never come. Poverty at grass roots level is a sorry story as majority of the population has no means of sustainable livelihood. There is rural exodus of youths. It is necessary to educate Africans that paid employments is no longer a REALITY in this country and that the only way out is SELF EMPLOYMENT (start a small business of your own). By so doing you take control of your worries, manage your destiny and provide security for your future. </p>

<p>Knowledge is only potential power says an adage and paves the road of RICHES when you know which road to take information brings transformation. If you are not informed you cannot be transformed. Enough information brings you to your destinations. This equally confirmed in the scripture (Hosea 4: 6). </p>

<p>Why we have large scale of unemployment in this country is because the country’s unemployed is made up of young people who lack PRODUCTIVE & MARKETABLE SKILLS.</p> 

<p>For investment to take place there must be investment opportunity, which could be a project. Its is time for you to Disrupt the Status Quo, WAKE UP & TAKE ACTION!!!!"</p>
